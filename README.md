# c-tcp-udp-client-server-app

The project involves multiplexing TCP and UDP connections, defining and utilizing a custom data type for a predefined protocol over UDP, and developing a client-server application using sockets.
The server facilitates communication among TCP clients, managing message publication and subscription. Additionally, UDP clients are integrated into the platform to publish messages using a predefined protocol.
The application also features a store-and-forward functionality to ensure message delivery even when TCP clients were disconnected."
